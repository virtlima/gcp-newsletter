This was due to the ALB prioritizing zones with low utilization (under 10%), leading to imbalanced distribution.  To achieve true traffic balance, the author suggests consulting GCP documentation for alternative configurations or contacting GCP support."}, {"recommendation_reason": "Provides information on securing GKE services, crucial for financial applications requiring high security.", "recommendation_title": "Secure Your GKE Services with Auth0, Identity-Aware Proxy and the Gateway API", "recommendation_link": "https://medium.com/google-cloud/secure-your-gke-services-with-auth0-identity-aware-proxy-and-the-gateway-api-6935587f7eba?source=rss----e52cf94d98af---4", "recommendation_summary": "This article details how to enhance the security of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) services.
